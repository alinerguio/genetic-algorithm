# Genetic Algorithm

## Goal
This work was developed for the Artificial Intelligence discipline to find the biggest value for x in the following function:

```
f(x) = x*x - 3x + 4,
```

Also, x [-10, +10], x is a binary vector, the mutation rate is 1% and the cross-over rate is 70%.

## Requirements
To use this code, you'll need this requirements.   

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8.2-green)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-382/)
[![Virtual Env](https://img.shields.io/badge/virtual--env-20.0.32-red)](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

When the repository is first cloned, use this commands:
```
$ virtualenv -p python3 env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, every time you want to acess, don't forget to activate you enviroment:
```
$ source env/bin/activate
```
